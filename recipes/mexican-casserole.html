        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Small dinner pie made with salsa, tortillas, refried beans, cheese, and onions.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>3/4 onion, diced</li>
            <li>5 (10 inch) flour tortillas</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Spray a 9-inch pie pan with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, cook refried beans and onions (to soften them) on medium-high heat for about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Place one tortilla in the bottom of the greased pan. Spread about 1/3 cup of the bean mixture over it. Layer a few tablespoons of salsa over this. Then, place another tortilla over the salsa, and add more of the bean mixture. Follow the beans with a big handful of cheese, spreading evenly. Repeat layers, spreading the ingredients evenly over the tortillas. On the top layer, make sure to use lots of salsa and cheese!</li>
            <li>Bake until the cheese is melted, aproximately 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
