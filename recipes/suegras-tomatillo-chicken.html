        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Chicken pieces are seared and then simmered in a tomatillo sauce. This is a mother in law's recipe from the state of Zacatecas, Mexico. Serve with warm tortillas and your choice of rice or beans as a side. We recommend a cold cola pop to accompany your delicious meal.</p>
