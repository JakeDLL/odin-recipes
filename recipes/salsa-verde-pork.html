        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Quick prep work leads to succulent, delicious, and exceptionally easy pork for enchiladas, tamales, or burritos or even to eat all by itself!</p>
        <p>We use this pork in all sorts of things, but my partner's favorite way is simply right out of the pot. I can't trust him to do the shreddint, because too much ends up in his mouth. This pork keeps well and gets even better after a day or two.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon canola oil</li>
            <li>1 (3 pound) boneless pork loin roast</li>
            <li>11 ounces green salsa</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat oil in large Dutch oven over medium-high heat. Brown pork loin in hot oil, 2 to 3 minutes per side.</li>
            <li>Transfer roast to the crock of a slow cooker. Pour green salsa over the pork.</li>
            <li>Cook on low for 5 hours.</li>
            <li>Shred the pork into strands with two forks; stir with the sauce so the texture is somewhat even. Continue cooking on low for 1 to 3 hours.</li>
        </ol>
