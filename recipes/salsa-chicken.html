        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This salsa chicken recipe is very easy and quick! Someone gave me this recipe a few years back, and it has become a household favorite. Depending on your taste you can use mild, medium, or hot salsa. I usually serve it with Spanish rice and Mexican-style canned corn.</p>
        
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

            <li>1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons sour cream (optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degreees C). Lightly grease a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
            <li>Place chicken breasts in the prepared dish. Sprinkle seasoning mix on both sides of chicken breasts; pour salsa on top.</li>

            <li>Sprinkle chicken evenly with cheese. Continue baking until cheese is melted and bubbly, 3 to 5 minutes more. Top with sour cream and serve.</li>
